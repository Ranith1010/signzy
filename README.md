# The determination of capability is based on the following criteria: Customers owning a single vehicle, especially premium two-wheelers or four-wheelers, are considered to have a high capability for renewal due to the higher value associated with these vehicles. Conversely, customers with multiple vehicles, particularly mass-market vehicles, are categorized as having medium capability. Vehicles in the "other" category typically indicate a low tendency for renewal.
